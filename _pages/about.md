I am interested in the numerical and theoretical studies on turbulent non/reacting flows. The specific interests include DNS of laminar or turbulent non/reacting flow and magnetohydrodynamics(MHD); High-performance computing (HPC) and code development; Low/no carbon fuels...

Flame-wall interaction for premixed methane/air flames diluted by hot combustion products (Ph.D.)
======
1,1D transient Head-On Quenching (HOQ) DNS was used to study unsteady FWI effects on CO thermochemical states. These 1D studies marked the effects of different working parameters, including dilution level, ambient pressure and wall temperature, and set a reference for the 2D and 3D setups. They provide the data required for such approaches followed for undiluted flames. 
2,The HOQ configuration cannot be used to investigate the effects of a velocity boundary layer. The use of a 2D channel flames enables a study of these effects. A forced inlet velocity allows the study of unsteady laminar FWI, which has been demonstrated to undergo a mix of HOQ, Side-Wall Quenching (SWQ) and premixed flame propagation in undiluted cases. The forcing introduces flame curvature and stretch effects, the study of which can aid the interrogation of 3D turbulent FWI results. The 2D flame also introduces tangential diffusion effects that can alter autoignition stability and chemistry.
3,Near-wall turbulence can wrinkle the flames and introduce mixing between combustion products and reactants. These factors affect near-wall CO transport. Heat loss inside the thermal boundary layer can inhibit autoignition and attenuate both the CO formation and oxidation rates. These effects were investigated with 3D turbulent DNS with analytically reduced chemical kinetics. Both hot and cold walls were investigated, to separate MILD autoignitive FWI from cold-wall quenching.

Design and simulation of a steam turbine and reciprocating engine (Master)
======
Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulation were performed on a steam turbine and reciprocating engine with ANSYS FLUENT software, especially for the optimization of a de Laval nozzle. The simulation helped compare the efficiency of two types of engines, and guide the engine selection at designed working conditions.

Energy transfer and third-order law in forced anisotropic MHD turbulence with hyperviscosity (Postdoc)
------
The Kolmogorov-Yaglom (third-order) law links energy transfer rates in the inertial range of magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence with third-order structure functions. Anisotropy, a typical property in the solar wind, largely challenges the applicability of the third-order law with isotropic assumption. To shed light on the energy transfer process in the presence of anisotropy, the present study conducted direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of forced MHD turbulence with normal and hyper-viscosity under various strengths of the external magnetic field (B0), and calculated three forms of third-order structure function with or without averaging azimuthal or polar angles to B0 direction. Correspondingly, three forms of estimated energy transfer rates were studied systematically with various B0. The result shows that the peak of the estimated longitudinal transfer rate occurs at larger scales as closer to the B0 direction, and its maximum shifts
away from the B0 direction at larger B0. Compared with normal viscous cases, hyper-viscous cases can attain better separation of the inertial range from the dissipation range, thus facilitating the analyses of the inertial range properties and the estimation of the energy cascade rates. We find that the widespread use of the isotropic form of
the third-order law in estimating the energy transfer rates is questionable in some cases, especially when the anisotropy arising from the mean magnetic field is inevitable. In contrast, the directionaveraged third-order structure function properly accounts for the effect of anisotropy and predicts the energy transfer rates and inertial range accurately, even at very high B0. With limited statistics, the calculation of the third-order structure function shows a stronger
dependence on averaging of azimuthal angles than the time, especially at high B0 cases. These findings provide insights into the anisotropic effect on the estimation of energy transfer rates.
